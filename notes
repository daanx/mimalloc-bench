put archives in extra storage (and somehow map that for CI)
	versionize archives for that
		get verions into the Makefile
		re-echo extern/versions.txt

port linux and sjm
fg: SSE2RNG is not used in the Makefile


Decisions made:
	dh: move build directory (src/build -> build)
	gd: modified extern/Makefile to not use sse
	lua: moved to big benchmarks because it is built in extern/
	benchmarks: if something is updated, CMakeLists.txt needs to be touched (because bench/ is not part of the make logic at all)
