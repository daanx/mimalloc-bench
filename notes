TODO
	put archives in extra storage (and somehow map that for CI)
		versionize archives for that
	port linux and sjm
	hd: Makefile fix (build-bench-env.sh, line 612: port to patch?)
	scudo needs only part of the source archive, maybe port partial_checkout to make and overwrite extern/scudo/.unpacked
	lp needs only part of WebKit (like scudo): port partial_checkout?
	pa: re-add
	adapt CI-scripts to use Makefile

Decisions made:
	VERSIONS: demand versions instead of reporting them in the end
	dh: move build directory (src/build -> build)
	gd: modified extern/Makefile to not use sse
	lua: moved to extern benchmarks because it is built in extern/
	benchmarks: if something is updated, CMakeLists.txt needs to be touched (because bench/ is not part of the make logic at all)
	sm: instead of default target, switched to building supermalloc only

Problems:
	fg: built purely for x86, can't test
	lt: same.
	sc: same.
	sm: same. NO_RTM=1 during compilation helps, but does not solve
