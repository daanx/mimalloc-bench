TODO
	put archives in extra storage (and somehow map that for CI)
		versionize archives for that
	port linux
	hd: Makefile fix (build-bench-env.sh, line 612: port to patch?)
	scudo needs only part of the source archive, maybe port partial_checkout to make?
	pa: re-add
	gd: detect architecture and set SSE2RNG if on x86, see gd/Makefile
	gd: arc4random named a function getentropy which chalshes with a libc functions
	lean: test bench.sh with smaller make-target: lean
	adapt CI-scripts to use Makefile
	we can give tar the list of files we want to extract or not extract

Decisions made:
	VERSIONS: demand versions instead of reporting them in the end
	switched from git cloning to grabbing a snapshot of the reqeuested version from github
	dh: move build directory (dh/src/build -> dh/build)
	lua: moved to extern benchmarks because it is built in extern/
	benchmarks: if something is updated, CMakeLists.txt needs to be touched (because bench/ is not part of the make logic at all)
	sm: instead of default target, switched to building supermalloc only

Problems:
	lp needs only part of WebKit (like scudo): port partial_checkout? Also, github does not serve archives on that repo. Re-add when solved.
	mesh, nomesh: bazel currently only supports x86_64; re-add when tested on x86
